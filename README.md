# Taiwan Travel Guide

A personal website introducing Taiwan through a local's perspective — its street food, must-visit places, culture, and practical travel tips.

Built as my first HTML + CSS project for the Web Application Development course at University College Dublin.

## Motivation

I'm Taiwanese, and I wanted to create something meaningful for my first web project. Rather than a generic demo site, I thought — why not introduce my home? This site is written from personal experience, aimed at anyone curious about visiting Taiwan, especially those based in Ireland.
